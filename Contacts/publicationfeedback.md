If you use the Computer Algebra System GAP in your research or teaching,
please tell us about such use. We are interested to see how GAP is used
for instance in order to plan the further development of the system.
Please write an ordinary e-mail letter to <support@gap-system.org>.

We would appreciate if you could give your name, organisation, and your
email address and tell us about your area of interest and your work
using GAP. In particular we are interested in the bibliographic data of
papers citing GAP (if any), which we would like to include into the
[Bibliography]({{ site.baseurl }}/Doc/Bib/bib.html) of such
papers kept by us.

If you think that your work may be of broader interest to other users of
GAP we encourage you even to send a report on it to the [GAP
Forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/Forum/forum.html).
