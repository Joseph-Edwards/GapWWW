On this page we will give a number of links that we hope to
be occasionally useful to have at hand for users of GAP,
although they have nothing directly to do with the system.
Most of the links go to web sites with lots of information
that we believe to be kept reasonably up to date for their
respective purpose.

### General.

A potentially useful site is the
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory) site. A fine
history can be found at the [St.
Andrews](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Abstract_groups/)
site. Further general information can be found via the websites of
mathematical societies and discussion forums. Also
[Andrei Marcus' Homepage](https://math.ubbcluj.ro/~marcus/) contains a
rich collection of links to mathematics on the web and in particular to
personal homepages of group theoreticians.

### Mathematical and other Societies.

The St Andrews "History of Mathematics" web site by J. O'Connor and
E. Robertson contains an
[Alphabetical List of Mathematical Societies](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/)
as well as a [Chronological List of Mathematical
Societies](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Societies/societies_list/).
For each Society/Academy listed, there is a link to a page describing
its history and at the bottom of that page you find a link to the home
page of the respective Society/Academy (where it is still current).

For convenience we give direct links to the home pages of a few
Societies:

-   [International Mathematical Union
    (IMU)](https://www.mathunion.org/),
-   [European Mathematical Society (EMS)](http://www.emis.de/),
-   [American Mathematical Society (AMS)](https://www.ams.org/),
-   [German Mathematical Society (DMV)](https://www.mathematik.de/), in
    particular its [Fachgruppe
    Computeralgebra](https://fachgruppe-computeralgebra.de).
-   [London Mathematical Society (LMS)](https://www.lms.ac.uk/).

Also see the home page of the [Association for computing
Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) (ACM) and its [Special Interest Group
in Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation](https://www.sigsam.org/) (ACM
SIGSAM).

### Conferences

A general overview can be found in the
[AMS Conference Calendar](https://www.ams.org/mathcal/).\
The meetings at the
["Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach"](https://www.mfo.de/)
can be found using the links on their homepage.\
A
[Collection of Meetings](https://www-circa.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/events/conferences/)
with relation to Group theory, related topics and in particular
Computational Group Theory is maintained in St Andrews.

### Fora

There are several adresses for discussion of mathematical questions.

In the [Group Pub Forum](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/gpf.html) you
have a good chance to get answers to theoretical questions from **group
theory** and related topics.\
The web page <http://listserv.nodak.edu/archives/nmbrthry.html> has
instructions on how to subscribe, send a mail, etc. to a **Number Theory
List**.\
Each of these websites also provides lots of general information.\
There are also
[Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gap) and
[MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/gap) sites
which are part of the [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/)
network of Q&A (question and answer) sites.

### People from History and Today.

The St Andrews
["History of Mathematics"](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/)
web site by J. O'Connor and E. Robertson collects cvs of many
mathematicians from the past and of a few outstanding ones of today.\
The
[Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu)
answers the question "Who was who's PhD thesis advisor?" far back
into history.

### Reviews and Preprints

[MathSciNet](https://www.ams.org/mathscinet) is a comprehensive database
covering the world's mathematical literature since 1940. It provides
Web access to the bibliographic data and reviews of mathematical
research literature contained in the Mathematical Reviews Database and
fosters the navigation of mathematics literature by providing links to
original articles and other original documents, when available.

Its competitor, [Zentralblatt MATH](https://zbmath.org/) is the world's
most complete and longest running abstracting and reviewing service in
pure and applied mathematics. The Zentralblatt MATH Database contains
more than 2.0 million entries drawn from more than 2300 serials and
journals and covers the period from 1868 - present by the recent
integration of the Jahrbuch database (JFM). The entries are classified
according to the Mathematics Subject Classification Scheme (MSC 2000).

The [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/) is an e-print service in the
fields of physics, mathematics, non-linear science, computer science,
and quantitative biology, operated by Cornell University. See also David
Benson's
[Preprint Archive](https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/archive.html)
on Groups, Representations and Cohomology.
