The GAP group encourages users to make their GAP related work available
to other users. There are two main categories of external contributions
to GAP, those that have been formally accepted in a
refereeing process, and those that are just deposited.

Irrespective of this distinction, you may consider organizing and maybe
distributing your code in the form of a GAP package. The page
[Information for GAP Package Authors]({{ site.baseurl }}/Packages/Authors/authors.html)
give detailed advice how to do this.

### Submitting Material for Formal Refereeing

The author of a contribution that is intended for formal acceptance
should begin the process by notifying the Chair of the
[GAP Council]({{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/People/Council/council.html)
by emailing <council@gap-system.org>, providing full information where
the complete material has been placed.

### Submitting Deposited Contributions

You are also invited to provide material that is not intended for formal
refereeing. To tell us about such material, contact
<support@gap-system.org>. (Packages can also be put into this category
while refereeing is in process.)

### The Refereeing Process

At its June 1997 meeting in Oberwolfach the
[GAP Council]({{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/People/Council/council.html)
established the category of "formally accepted" contributions, and
agreed upon the following procedures for refereeing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Materials submitted for formal acceptance as part of the GAP
distribution, typically packages or proposed additions to the GAP
library, will undergo an additional review resembling the refereeing
process for journal articles. As with submitted journal articles,
authors will have the option during the review process of withholding
their contributions from being made public in the /deposit directory.

Upon being notified of the author's intent, the Chair, acting as
editor-in-chief, will notify the Council about the submission and will
designate a member of the Council as the associate editor responsible
for the submission. The associate editor may draw upon the services of
additional referees, including experts familiar with the programming
issues involved, to determine whether the material is suitable for
formal acceptance or to recommend revisions. Once the responsible editor
concludes that the contribution is ready to be part of the GAP
distribution, it will be announced to the GAP Forum and listed on the
GAP Web page, and the materials will be included in the next appropriate
release of GAP.

The author should not alter the submitted material during the refereeing
process without notifying the editor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The intent of the formal review process is not only to encourage the
development of the best possible GAP materials but also to provide
authors with recognition for their professional contributions more or
less equivalent to that for publication of a journal article. In
particular, referees are expected to apply standards comparable to those
they would use for articles. It is not unusual for a referee to propose
extensive modifications as conditions of acceptance.

A referee will consider the following basic questions in reviewing a
submitted GAP package.

-   Does the package do what it claims to?
-   Is its functionality a significant addition to GAP?
-   Does the package interact smoothly with the existing GAP library and
    packages?
-   Does the package employ appropriate GAP functions and data
    structures?
-   Is the main documentation clear and complete enough?

This last point is especially important. The installation of the package
must work as described in the installation guide, without help from
system staff. The package's documentation should include
straightforward and quick examples to help the user test the
installation, the examples of the manual must really work the way the
manual says, and the overall documentation should be organized sensibly.

The referee will also ask how the package reacts to unexpected or very
special input. Does it work for the trivial group, the empty list, etc?

Adherence to these standards is critical both for maintaining reliably
high quality in the GAP distribution and for providing package authors
with credible professional recognition of their work.

The Council is actively seeking contributions, not only for formal
acceptance, but also for all of the /deposit subdirectories. If you have
materials that might be suitable, please consider making them available
to the whole GAP community. Please also feel free to write directly to
any member of the Council about possible contributed materials or about
any other GAP-related matters of which the Council should be aware. We
provide a list with the names and current mail and email addresses of
the [members]({{ site.baseurl }}/Contacts/People/Council/council.html)
of the GAP Council.
