<p>
  Although, fortunately, GAP is not yet part of history,
  we have kept a few documents marking steps of its development.
  In particular, the prefaces of the manuals of the various releases
  sketch the respective progress. We present here links to (relevant
  extracts from) these prefaces as well as to some 'interim reports'
  that appeared in the GAP Forum. (For recent developments see the
  <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/master/CHANGES.md">Release&nbsp;history</a>.)

<h3>Old Packages</h3>  
  <p>
  No longer redistributed with GAP or renamed:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Carat - this package has been renamed to
       <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~gaehler/gap/packages.php">CaratInterface</a>.</li>
    <li>Citrus - this package has been renamed to
       <a href="https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups">Semigroups</a>.</li>
    <li>Convex - this package has been superseded by
       <a href="https://homalg-project.github.io/pkg/NConvex">NConvex</a>.</li>
    <li>Gpd - this package has been renamed to
       <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/groupoids/">groupoids</a>.</li>
    <li>HAPprime - part of 
       the code has been incorporated into the
       <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/hap">HAP</a> package. 
       Its source code repository, containing the code of the 
       last distributed version, can still be found on GitHub
       <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/happrime">here</a>.</li>
    <li>if - this package has been withdrawn; a better 
       functionality is now included in the newer package
       <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/hap">SCSCP</a>.</li>
    <li>LAG - the functionality of this package is now included
      in the newer package <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/laguna">LAGUNA</a>.</li>
    <li>linboxing - this package does not compile for
      several years preceding GAP&nbsp;4.10 release,
      and is unmaintained. It was therefore dropped from the GAP
      package distribution, but the latest sources are available
      <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/linboxing">here</a>.</li>
    <li>MONOID - the functionality of this package is now included in the
       newer package <a href="https://semigroups.github.io/Semigroups">Semigroups</a>.</li>
    <li>NQL - this package has been
      withdrawn by the author, and later has been superseded by
      the package <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/lpres">lpres</a>.</li>
    <li>ParGAP - this package does not compile with GAP 4.9 (see 
      <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2018-March/001082.html">this announcement</a>).
      Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, 
      plus some first fixes needed for compatibility for GAP 4.9,
      can still be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/pargap">here</a>.</li>
    <li>PolymakeInterface - this package has been withdrawn.</li>
    <li>QaoS is no longer redistributed with
      GAP (see 
      <a href="https://mail.gap-system.org/pipermail/gap/2019-March/001155.html">this announcement</a>).
      Its source code repository, containing the code of the last distributed version, 
      can still be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/qaos">here</a>.</li>
    <li>recogbase - this package has been merged into the
       <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/recog">recog</a> package, and
       therefore is no longer distributed with GAP.</li>
  </ul>
