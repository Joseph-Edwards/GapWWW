  For an overview of computational methods for permutation groups see
  for example the book "Permutation Group Algorithms" of
  √Åkos Seress. Historically, these methods
  started with Charles Sims' method for finding the order and a stabilizer
  chain nowadays known as the Schreier-Sims method, which is the basis of
  many functions implemented in GAP. To give a small sample
  of further special methods:
</p>
<p>
  The nearly linear time methods for permutation groups include functions
  to compute
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a stabilizer chain,
  </li>
  <li>
    p-core,
  </li>
  <li>
    radical,
  </li>
  <li>
    centre,
  </li>
  <li>
    composition series.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are also tasks for which no polynomial time methods are known and
  for which GAP relies on partition backtrack methods, for
  example
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    centralizer,
  </li>
  <li>
    normalizer, or
  </li>
  <li>
    intersection of subgroups.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The GAP4 package [RCWA](https://gap-packages.github.io/rcwa/)
  provides   methods  for  computations   with  the   so-called  Residue
  Class-Wise  Affine   mappings  of  certain  euclidian   rings  R  into
  themselves  and the  groups generated  by bijective  mappings  of this
  type.  The latter mappings form a proper subgroup of Sym(R).

  For {% include ref.html label="Matrix Groups" text="matrix&nbsp;groups" %}.
  there are also special methods in the GAP library
  and a private GAP4 package 
  [matrixss](http://matrixss.sourceforge.net) 
  implements  a
  <a href="http://henrik.baarnhielm.net/schreiersims.pdf">
  Schreier-Sims&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;for&nbsp;matrix&nbsp;groups</a>,
  including both the standard deterministic and the standard
  probabilistic approach.

<p>
  The package
  [Polenta](https://gap-packages.github.io/polenta/) allows to find
  {% include ref.html label="Pc Groups" text="polycyclic&nbsp;presentations" %}
