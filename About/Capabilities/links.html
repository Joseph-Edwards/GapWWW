The world of computational algebra is wide, GAP has been collaborating with various other systems and there are many different ways that GAP interfaces with external systems.

These include:
<ul>
  <li>
    An interface to  <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI/GP</a> system 
    in the [Alnuth](https://gap-packages.github.io/alnuth) package.
  </li>
  <li>
    An interface
    [singular](https://gap-packages.github.io/singular/) to the
    [SINGULAR](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de) system for
    algebraic geometry, allowing to apply the functions of SINGULAR to
    the objects of GAP, allowing in particular fast
    computation of
    Groebner bases, computation of gcd and factorization of multivariate
    polynomials, as well as computation of invariant rings of finite
    groups.
  </li>
  <li>
     A GAP package 
    [openmath](https://gap-packages.github.io/openmath) 
    allowing GAP users to import and export
    mathematical objects encoded in 
    [OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org/), for the purpose of 
    exchanging them with other applications which are OpenMath enabled. 
    (If the OpenMath site don't work, try the 
    <a href="http://openmath.activemath.org/">unofficial&nbsp;mirror</a>.)
  </li>
  
  <li>
     A GAP package 
    [SCSCP](https://gap-packages.github.io/scscp) which implements the 
    [Symbolic Computation Software Composability Protocol](http://www.symbolic-computing.org/scscp). 
    Using it, GAP can communicate locally or remotely with any other 
    OpenMath-enabled SCSCP-compliant application which may be not only another computer algebra 
    system but also another instance of the GAP system or even, for example, an external 
    Java or C/C++ application that uses SCSCP API. 
    See the <a href=" http://www.symbolic-computing.org/">SCIEnce project homepage</a>
    for the details about computer algebra systems and other sotware supporting SCSCP.
  </li>
  <li>
    An interface
    <a href="http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/discreta/GAP/discreta_gap.html">
    DISCRETA&nbsp;-&nbsp;GAP</a> to the program 
    [DISCRETA](http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/discreta/)
    for  the construction of t-designs   with   prescribed  automorphism 
    group   by  A.   Betten, E. Haberberger, R. Laue, and A. Wassermann.
    This interface is provided by 
    <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~betten">Anton&nbsp;Betten</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    An interface to the [4ti2](http://www.4ti2.de/) package for
    algebraic, geometric and combinatorial problems on linear spaces
    in the [4ti2Interface](https://homalg-project.github.io/pkg/4ti2Interface) package.
  </li>
  <li>
    The [PolymakeInterface](https://gap-packages.github.io/polymaking/) package
    provides a link to the callable library of the
    [polymake](http://www.polymake.org/) system.
  </li>
  <li>
   The computer algebra system SAGE (available from
   <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">http://www.sagemath.org</a>
   and its mirrors) includes GAP, though packages, 
   and libraries, such as the smallgroups library and the table of marks, 
   must be installed separately. SAGE also includes (i.a.) 
   <ul>
   <li>
   [Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
   </li>
   <li>
   [Pari](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/), 
   </li>
   <li>
   the number theory library  [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/), 
   </li>   
   <li>
   [Maxima](http://maxima.sf.net/), 
   </li>
   <li>
   [Python](http://www.python.org/), the programming language 
   it uses. 
   </li>
   </ul>
  Two webpages explaining ways in which SAGE interacts with GAP are the 
  section "Programming SAGE using GAP" in the
  <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/">
  SAGE&nbsp;Developers&nbsp;Guide</a>
  and the section "The GAP Interface" in the
  <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/">
  SAGE&nbsp;Reference&nbsp;Manual</a>.
