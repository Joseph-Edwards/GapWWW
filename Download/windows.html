<p>
Installing the GAP distribution with all the packages and full data
libraries from source code requires a working C and C++ development
environment on your system as well as GNU make.
</p>

<p>
For users of Windows 10, we strongly recommend using GAP via the 
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.
Otherwise, we recommend the use of <code>.exe</code> installer which can be found 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Releases/{{site.data.release.version}}.html">here</a>. 
It contains binaries for GAP(compiled with the support of GMP and readline libraries) and for selected
GAP packages, and provides the standard installation procedure. 
No compilation is needed, since compiled executables for GAP 
and some packages are already provided by the <code>.exe</code> installer.
</p>

<p>
If you want to try to build binaries 
for more packages, you may install <a href="https://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
to get a UNIX environment for Windows, selecting all needed tools 
during Cygwin installation.
