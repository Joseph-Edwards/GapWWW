To install development tools on a Linux system, use your preferred package 
manager (e.g. apt-get or aptitude or Synaptic etc.). 
You need a working C and C++ development environment on your system as well as GNU <code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only to 
compile the core system, but also some of its packages. To install 
GAP using the source distribution, perform the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify that all required tools are installed. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian do this by calling
    <p>
    <code>sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool libgmp-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev</code>
    </p>
</li>
<li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Releases/{{site.data.release.version}}.html">download</a> 
the corresponding archive.</li>
<li>Unpack the archive.</li>
<li>Compile the GAP core system by running 
    <p>
    <code>./configure; make</code> 
    </p>
in the unpacked directory.</li>
<li>Change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
<p>
<code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> 
</p>
to run the script which will build most of
the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
and tools are available). If something doesn't work on your system, please
refer to the <code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
</li>
<li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons etc., to make the new version of GAP available to the users of your machine.</li>
<li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
</ol>
