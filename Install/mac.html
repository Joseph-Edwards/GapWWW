Installing the GAP distribution with all the packages and full data
libraries from source code requires a working C and C++ development
environment on your system as well as GNU make.
</p>

<p>
    You need to install the Apple developer tools. If you are on
    macOS 10.11 or newer, this can be achieved by opening a terminal window
    and entering the command <code>xcode-select --install</code>. A window will appear
    asking you whether you would like to install the command line developer
    tools. Confirm this by clicking the “Install” button. After this
    completed, you can verify that it worked by verifying that the directory
    <code>/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/</code> exists and contains executables
    such as `clang` and `clang++`.
</p>


<p>
    Note that to obtain a fully functional GAP installation you need not only to 
    compile the core system, but also some of its packages. To install 
    GAP using the source distribution, perform the following steps:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Verify that all required tools are installed.</li>
    <li>Choose your preferred archive format and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/Releases/{{site.data.release.version}}.html">download</a> 
    the corresponding archive.</li>
    <li>Unpack the archive.</li>
    <li>Compile the GAP core system
    by running <code>./configure; make</code> in the unpacked directory.</li>
    <li>Change to the <code>pkg</code> subdirectory and call
    <code>../bin/BuildPackages.sh</code> to run the script which will build most of
    the packages that require compilation (provided sufficiently many libraries, headers
    and tools are available). If something doesn't work on your system, please
    refer to the <code>README</code> file provided with the corresponding package. 
    </li>
    <li>Adjust some links/scripts/icons etc., to
    make the new version of GAP available to the users of your machine.</li>
    <li>Optional: run a few tests.</li>
    </ol>



<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<h4>
    Homebrew
  </h4>
  <p>
  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the package manager for macOS.
  If you use Homebrew, you can install GAP using the
  <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/homebrew-gap">GAP Homebrew tap</a>.
  </p>

<h4>
    Gap.app
</h4>
  <p>
  <a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/">Gap.app</a> is a native macOS frontend
  and distribution of GAP, developed by Russ Woodroofe.  The "Gap.app + GAP" edition
  includes a fairly complete copy of GAP, and can be installed by simply downloading a
  disk image and dragging Gap.app to the Applications folder.  You can also install the built-in
  GAP for use from your usual terminal via the Install GAP Command For Shell menu option
  (found under the Gap menu in the GUI frontend).
  </p>
  <p>The included GAP comes with working copies of most of the packages in the
  standard GAP distribution.  Gap.app is compatible with 
  <a href="https://gap-packages.github.io/xgap/">XGAP</a>, and allows interactive display
  of subgroup lattices with the <code>GraphicSubgroupLattice</code> command. 
  The version of GAP that comes with Gap.app may lag slightly behind the very latest.
  Full details on the currently included GAP may be found in the 
    <a href="https://cocoagap.sourceforge.io/faq.html#gapversioninfo">Gap.app FAQ</a>.
