### Contents

This library is part of the core GAP system. It contains Q-class
representatives of all irreducible maximal finite integral matrix groups
of dimension up to 31 and Z-class representatives of those among these
groups which are of dimension at most 11 or of dimension 13, 17, 19, or
23.

### Authors of the data listings

Wilhelm Plesken, Bernd Souvignier, and Gabriele Nebe.

### Author of the GAP implementation

Volkmar Felsch.

### Source

Several papers by the authors which are quoted in the GAP reference
manual section:
